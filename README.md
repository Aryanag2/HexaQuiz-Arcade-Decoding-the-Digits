# HexaQuiz Arcade: Decoding the Digit

HexaQuiz Arcade is a fun and educational game where players can test their skills in hexadecimal arithmetic. The game challenges players to solve arithmetic problems by decoding the correct hexadecimal values using FPGA switches as input.

## Functionality of the Game

The game consists of the following features and game mechanics:

### Main Menu

- The main menu allows players to select the game mode using FPGA switches.
- The available game modes include:
  - Easy Mode: In this mode, players are presented with one hexadecimal arithmetic problem to solve.
  - Medium Mode: In this mode, players are presented with two hexadecimal arithmetic problems to solve.
  - Hard Mode: In this mode, players are presented with one hexadecimal multiplication problem to solve.
- Players can use the FPGA switches to choose their desired game mode.

### Inputting Answers

- Once the game mode is selected, players will use the FPGA switches to input their answers to the arithmetic problems.
- In Easy and Medium modes, players need to input the correct hexadecimal values using the switches.
- In Hard mode, players need to input the correct binary representation of the hexadecimal multiplication result using the switches.

### Hexadecimal Display

- During the game, a hex display will show the current value in hexadecimal format.
- This display helps players visualize the values and make informed decisions when inputting their answers.

### Time Limit and Progress Bar

- The game runs for a duration of 3 minutes, providing an exciting and challenging experience.
- To indicate the remaining time, a color-changing progress bar is displayed, giving players a visual representation of the time remaining.

### Leaderboard

- After the game ends, the player's score is recorded in the leaderboard.
- The leaderboard updates every time the game is played, allowing players to track their progress and compete for high scores.
